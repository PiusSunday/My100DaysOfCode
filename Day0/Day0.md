# Day 0

Day 0 generally includes all the preparations leading up to this challenge, It involves outlining my WHY for taking up this challenge and setting up my workspace, the resources/roadmaps I'll be following and everything else.

I made sure I put in place everything I need to take up this challenge.

- Created this GitHub repo to track my progress.
- Made some notes on my goals for taking up this challenge and some encouraging notes I placed on my wall to remind me anytime I feel like giving up.
