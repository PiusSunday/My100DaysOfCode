# Day 11

Today, I took time to rest, which means I didn't do much of coding.

I was having a problem with changing the Language that appears on my repository when I upload my Flutter Projects to Github.

The problem was that the Language that appears on my repository was C++, which is not the language that I used to build my Flutter Projects.

So I took time to find the solutions and fix the problem which I did eventually.

I found out the cause of this anomaly was due to the extra folders like MacOS, Linux and Windows getting pushed to my repository also, the best solution was to delete the folders since I didn't need them neither did the project because I was solely building for Android, iOS and the Web.
