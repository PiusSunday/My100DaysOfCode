# Day 43

-- Today, I reviewed some old projects and I continued reading the Flutter Apprentice Book.

The chapter 3 which I started yesterday is about the Flutter Widgets, the building blocks of Flutter Apps. I enjoy the step by step approach of the book, it's very easy to follow and understand, and it's very detailed.

I think I'll have to see the book through to the end since I'm enjoying each chapter as I go.
