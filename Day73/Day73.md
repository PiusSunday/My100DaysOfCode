# Day 73

Today, I continued working on the Multi Client Chat App with Java.

It's a school project, we have to make a chat app that can handle multiple clients.

We also have to configure the Server and Clients to be able to run on a Graphical User Interface. (GUI)!

I added a new feature to the server, which is the ability to send a message to a specific client and send a broadcast message to all clients.
