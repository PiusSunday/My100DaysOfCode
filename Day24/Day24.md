# Day 24

Today, I read some of the Flutter documentation and learnt some advanced Dart concepts like Enums, Maps and Ternary Operator.

I started building a Payment Checkout UI I found on Twitter, Though I didn't finish it yet as I had to do some other work to finish up.

The difficulty I'm facing with this UI is the logic for the Radio Button on the Payment Method section, but I'm sure I'll get it done.
