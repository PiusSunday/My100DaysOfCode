# Day 11

Today, I completed building the Quiz App.

I also worked on the project I'm currently on for my Internship, where I chnaged the UI to match the design made by the design team and adding some validation authentication.

In the process of Building Quizzler App, I learnt,

- Modularising your code into separate classes.
- Dart classes and objects.
- Using class constructors.
- The concept of Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism in Dart.
- Extracting Widgets to refactor your code.
- private and public modifiers in Dart.
- How to use Dart lists.
- The difference between var, const and final in Dart.
