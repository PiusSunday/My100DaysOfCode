# Day 70

I had a bug in my code that I couldn't figure out for a while.

Today, I took time to analyze the code and try to figure out what was wrong and where.

I finally found the bug and fixed it.

The bug was in one of the functions that I created to validate users and keep track of their authentication status and also to add a user information to the database.
