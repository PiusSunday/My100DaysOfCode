# Day 80

Today, I didn't do much of coding other than reviewing and refactoring part of the code of the Smart Home App I'm working on.

I rather did a some school work on Cisco Packet Tracer which was about configuring a router that connects different networks and also configuring a switch that connects different devices.

We also had to configure firewall ACLs to allow or deny traffic from different networks based on some layed out rules.
