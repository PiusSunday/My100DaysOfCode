# Day 64

Today, was all about Firebase for the Smart Home App project.

I'll be using Firebase as the backend of the project for services like Authentication, etc.

I'll be working on the Sign Up and Login UIs tonight before doing some school work.

Back to school means, Less time I can spend coding but I'll keep working and improving each day.
