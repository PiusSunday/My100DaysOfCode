# Day 4

- I spent today working on a profile setup page UI design I found on Twitter.

- The difficulty I faced working on this UI was trying to align the 'Username' and 'Pronouns' TextField side by side.

- After taking a break and resting, I found a way to align them side by side but there was a RenderBox overflow for the Pronouns TextField, this was due to the 'width' I initially gave the SizedBox containing each of the TextFields.

- I felt tired today, probably because I didn't get enough sleep from last night.

- Visited some old Lessons I did on Python Basics.
