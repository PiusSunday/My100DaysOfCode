Today, I completed building the Quiz App.

I also worked on the project I'm currently on for my Internship, where I chnaged the UI to match the design made by the design team and adding some validation authentication.

## Day 12

Today, I took time to rest, which means I didn't do much of coding.

I was having a problem with changing the Language that appears on my repository when I upload my Flutter Projects to Github.

So I took time to find the solutions and fix the problem which I did eventually.
