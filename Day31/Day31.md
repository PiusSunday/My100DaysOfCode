# Day 31

Today, I did some research on APIs and tried to work with a Sport API but it didn't go as planned.

I'm currently reading a Flutter Book from b-ok.africa "Flutter Apprentice: Learn to Build Cross-Platform Apps, 2nd Edition" by Mike Katz, Kevin D. Moore, Vincent Ngo, Vincenzo Guzzi.

## Just a side note

It's been a month since I started this #100DaysOfCode challenge and I'm happy to say that I've been able to keep up with it. I'm also happy to say that I've been able to learn a lot of new things and also improve on some of the things I already knew. It's been a great experience so far and I'm looking forward to the next month and keeping up with the same momentum and energy. To be consistent and to be productive each day.
