# Day 26

Today, I started another Course section from the Flutter BootCamp course I'm taking on Udemy with Angela Yu.

I learnt,

- How to get Location Data from across different platforms using the geolocator package and plugins.
- Dart's Futures, Async and Await concepts.
- Stateless and Stateful Widgets Life Cycle Methods.

I'm still finding it hard to grab the concepts of Async and Await, but I'll watch some more videos and pratice more to understand it better.
