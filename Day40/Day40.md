# Day 40

-- Today, I met up with a team mate to discuss the App Progress, Code together and clean up our code and GitHub branches.

I worked on the Statistics screen of the App.

I also took time to clean up my code and implement OOP on some of the Widgets.

-- I also took a deep dive into the FlutterFire documentation on Cloud Firestore, I'll continue with it tommorow then start implementing the BackEnd for the User Datas and Statistics feature of the App.
