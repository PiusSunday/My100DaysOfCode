# Day 74

Today, I continued working on the Multi Client Chat App with Java.

Still trying to figure out how to make the GUI work with the server and clients.

I read a documentation about how to make a GUI with Java Swing, and I'm trying to implement it into my project.

Currently watching a video on youtube about how to implement the Chat App to work on the GUI with Java Swing.
