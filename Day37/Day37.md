# Day 37

Today, I met up with some of my team mates to discuss the progress of our project and next steps.

We made a few changes to the existing UI, discussed about the BackEnd and possible ways of intergrating new features to our App then we coded for a few hours.

I will be working on the Authentication feature of the App tonight with Firebase as well diving deep into the FlutterFire documentation.
