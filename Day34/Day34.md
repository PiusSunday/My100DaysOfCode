# Day 34

Today, I spent most of my day reviewing old notes and continued reading the Flutter book on b-ok.africa.

I also watched some videos on YouTube for the Widget series I'm currently following.

I had a team meeting with my team mates where we discussed and analyzed some of the project ideas and improvements we can make to the project we're currently working on.
