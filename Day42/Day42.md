# Day 42

-- Today, I worked on the Profile Screen for the App I'm currently building with my teammates.

I also cleaned up and refactored the code for the Bitcoin Ticker App.

## Building this App, I learned

- How to use the DropdownButton Widget from Material design.

- How to loop through code using Dart for and for-in loops.

- How to use Cupertino Widgets in a Flutter App.

- How to check the platform your app is being run on to customise the UI for that platform.

- Getting live data from the internet using the http package.
- Using free API's to get live data.
