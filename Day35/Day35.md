# Day 35

Yesterday, I tried to create a new branch and push to the GitHub Organization Repository of my team but I faced a lot issues since I never did that before.

It wasn't he usual adding, commiting and pushing to my remote repository, I had to create a new branch and push to the remote repository of the Organization which I never did before.

Today, I spent most of the day learning some of these advanced things in and about GitHub.

I learnt,

- How to create an Organization on GitHub.

- How to Fork a Repository on GitHub.

- How to Clone a Repository on GitHub from the CLI.

- How to Create a new Branch on GitHub.

- How to Create a Pull Request on GitHub.

- How to Push a new Branch to GitHub.
