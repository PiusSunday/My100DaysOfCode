# Day 6

Today, I Built two  Flutter Apps with gesture detection functionalities.

## 1. Dicee ðŸŽ²

Dicee is a simple dice rolling app. It allows you to roll a dice and get the result. You can make the die roll at the press of any of the left or right dice button.

You can also Reset the dice to default by pressing the Reset button.

With this app in your pocket, you'll be able to settle any score on the go!

## 2. Magic 8 Ball ðŸŽ±

A magical 8 ball app with Gesture Detection functionalities. It will give you the answers to all the tricky questions in life. You can make the ball change at the press of a button.

You can ask the app a question and press the ball button to give you a response.

This app solidifies my understanding of the Gesture Detection functionalities as well as the differences between Stateful and Stateless widgets.
