# Day 70

Well, as they say, "One Bug Down, One Bug to Go".

After finding and fixing some of the bugs from yesterday, I ran into some others today, which I'm still trying to figure out.

I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to fix them today, but I'll try my best.

I'm currently doing some school work, might have to get back to coding tomorrow.
