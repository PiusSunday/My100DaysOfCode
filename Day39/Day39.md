# Day 39

-- Today, I continued with Authentication feature of the App with Firebase.

I was able to implement the Phone Authentication feature of the App to work on both Android and iOS devices.

I spent so much time than I expected trying to work on the Resend OTP function of the Phone Authentication, It was a bit tricky but I was able to figure it out, going from one error to another and back. I'm glad I was able to figure it out.

Currently refactorring the code and trying to make it more readable and understandable.

-- I also had a survey session with a PHD Researcher of Computer Science at the Glasgow University, we talked about the BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) and how they are used in the Software Development Industry.

We went through some of the scenarios of a Software Development Project which involved working with Gherkin and some hands-on practice exercises.
