# Day 41

-- Today, I continued with the Flutter Bootcamp Course, we had a challenge to create a to create a Bitcoin Ticker App.

This App uses the CoinAPI to get the current price of different Crypto Coins in different currencies.

A user will be able to select any of the Currencies and the App will display the current price of the available Crypto Coins in the selected Currency.

I was able to complete the challenge and I'm happy with the result, I'll spend the rest of the night cleaning up my code and adding some more features to the App to make it more user friendly.
