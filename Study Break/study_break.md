# I'm Taking A Break From The 100DaysOfCode Challenge

Usually, today would be Day 81 of the 100DaysOfCode challenge. But I'm taking a break from the challenge for a while.

When I returned to studying a month ago, I thought I would be able to combine my studies and focus on the 100DaysOfCode challenge. But I was wrong. I'm not able to do both at the same time.

Lately, I've been getting overwhelmed with a lot of school work, which requires me to spend a lot of time on my studies, thereby leaving me with little time to focus on the 100DaysOfCode challenge, which is why I'm taking a break from the challenge for a while.

My goal for the 100DaysOfCode Challenge was to improve my coding skills, build projects and contribute to open source projects whilst improving each day, and to achieve that, I needed to give my 100% to the challenge. But I'm not able to do that at the moment.

I'll be back to the challenge when I have a break from a lot of school work and I'm ready to give my 100% to the challenge.
