# Day 48

-- Today was the last day of a 3 Day FinTech event I attended, I couldn't do much during the past 3 days as I was pretty much occupied all days long.

I'm curently on a night long train travel back to my city to be able to attend my first class of the semester tomorrow.

I might end up coding through the journey or read some books.
