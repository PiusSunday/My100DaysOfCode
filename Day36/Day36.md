# Day 36

-- Today, I started a new course section of the Flutter Development Bootcamp I'm currently following on Udemy.

We are currently building a BitCoin Ticker App: A Mobile App that will allow a user to be able to find out the live price of Bitcoin in any currency of their choice.

I learnt,

- Using the the Material DropdownButton Widget to create a Dropdown Menu.

- Dart Loops and how to use them to create a list of Widgets.

-- I also worked on parts of the UI of the App my teammates and I are currently working on.

I was able to push the code to the GitHub Organization Repository of my team without any issues, thanks to the help of my team mate who helped and explained some of the things I was doing wrong.
