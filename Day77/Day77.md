# Day 77

For Day 77, which was yesterday, I couldn`t update my progress because I was so tired and I needed to take some rest.

A nap which was supposed to last for about two hours turned out to be a 7 hour sleep and I woke up at 3:00 AM. ðŸ˜‚

Anyways, I yestrday, I did some work on the Smart Home App, I moved on with the next CRUD operation, which is the `Read` operation.

I so right now, I have the `Create` and `Read` operations working on the app for User Accounts.
