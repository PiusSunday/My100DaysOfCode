# Day 32

Today, I went back to learning about some Interesting and very useful Flutter Widgets.

I also used some of the Widgets I learnt about to build a simple Flutter App.

I learnt,

- How to make a Custom Carousel Slider Widget in Flutter.

- How to use the TabBar and TabBarView Widgets.

- Using the ListView.builder() and PageView.builder() Widgets.

- Making a Custom Bottom Navigation Bar.
