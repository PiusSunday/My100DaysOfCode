# Day 14

Today being a weekend day, I took advantage of the day to do some off-coding personal stuff and lots of resting.

Today, I coded for about 3 hours and 15 minutes.

I reviewed my team project and made a documentation on some of the APIs needed for some of the App's features and functionalities.
