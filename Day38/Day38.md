# Day 38

Today, I started working on the Authentication feature of the App with Firebase as well diving deep into the FlutterFire documentation.

I spent most of the day reading the FlutterFire documentation and trying to understand how to implement the Authentication feature of the App.

I'm currently trying to implement the Firebase Phone Authentication feature in the App to work on both Android and iOS devices.

My goal is to have the Phone Authentication feature of the App working on both Android and iOS devices by tomorrow.
