# Day 61

Today, I continued working on the home screen of the smart home app I'm working on. I also worked on the onboarding screens.

- I added some functionalities to the smart home system

- I added some animations to the onboarding Screen. I used the `Lottie` widget to add animations to the onboarding screen. I also added a `PageView` to the onboarding screen. I used the `PageView` to display the onboarding screens.
