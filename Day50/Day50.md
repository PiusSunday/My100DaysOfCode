# Day 50

Today, I continued readng the Flutter Apprentice book, and I’m on Chapter 4, which is about the Flutter Widgets in details.

It takes a deep dive into the theory of widgets to help you better understand how to use them.

I learnt,

• What Widgets really are
• Widget rendering
• Flutter Trees
• Types of widgets
• Widget lifecycle

I also watched a Flutter video For more details on Flutter widget rendering and how they work under the hood.
