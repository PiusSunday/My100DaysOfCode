# Day 9

Today, I didn't do much other than reviewing my old notes and reading the Introduction to Flutter Book and the Dart Programming Language on b-ok.africa website.

I also praticed more on Dart Functions and the various types. It's fascinating to see how the language evolved and how it can be used in different contexts.

I also made a documentation on the code migration I did yesterday of an old App from the company I'm interning at.

It was quite tasking going from one error to another but the joy of learning something new is the joy of solving a problem.
