# Day 33

Today, I continued with learning about some of the design oriented widgets and trying to recreate simple designs with the Widgets.

Some of the widgets like,

- ClipOval Widget

- ClipRRect Widget

I also read the flutter documentation on working with Network Data and using the HTTP Package as well as reading some of the CookBooks.
