# Day 75

Today, my binome and I finally got the Multi Client Chat App to work with the GUI.

After a lot of trials and errors, we finally got it to work, thanks to his great efforts.

Both the Server and every connected Client can now send and receive messages on the GUI.

The server handles the connected clients and broadcasts messages from one Client to all the other Clients.

We used the Java Swing library to make the GUI.
